# `mapping-template` Evaluation

Repository containing artifacts and results for the `mapping-template` evaluation.

## Qualitative Evaluation 

Examples defined for the evaluation are in the `mapping-template` repository ([examples](https://github.com/cefriel/mapping-template/tree/main/examples)). In this repository we report the [table](conceptual-mapping-reqs-eval.xlsx) summarising the evaluation against the Conceptual Mapping ontology requirements ([repository](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Conceptual-Mapping/tree/main/requirements)).

Additionally the folder `kgc-challenge-2024\track1` contain the configuration file, the generated templates and the obtained results for evaluating the compliance of the `mapping-template` tool w.r.t all the test cases of the [RML Core](https://w3id.org/rml/portal) module specification.

## Quantitative Evaluation 

### Preliminary tests

To test the performance and scalability of the `mapping-template` tool, we considered the GTFS-Madrid-Bench. The benchmark provides a set of (R2)RML mappings and a generator to create input data sources in different formats and sizes. We considered three data formats (CSV, XML and JSON) and three scaling factors (1,10,100) comparing the `mapping-template` tool with the 
[`rmlmapper`](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java) v6.1.2 and [`morph-kgc`](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java) v2.3.1 processors. We adopted a set of RML mappings simplifying the _join_ operation for the GTFS shapes file as in [1].

A set of templates implementing the same mapping rules were generated for the `mapping-template` tool (`*-no-self-join.vm`). In this first set of templates, we defined a _join_ operation between two data frames as specified by the join condition in RML to guarantee a more fair comparison. An additional set of templates (`*-no-join.vm`), compared in the evaluation as `mapping-template-nj`, is defined to test the performances of the template approach using optimised mappings without _join_ operations.

### Knowledge Graph Construction Challenge

Configuration files for the participation in the KGCW Challenge 2024 and subsequent tests for the SWJ paper are contained in the `kgc-challenge-2024` folder. The result of other engines are taken from the challenge results published by the organisers at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11577087.
